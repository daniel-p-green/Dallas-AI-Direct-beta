# Progress Log
Run: 84df7505-2a56-4073-8004-98f6d769f276
Task: Project: Dallas AI Direct Alpha. Task: Create a minimal brand implementation package using Vercel Geist brand guidelines and icons for demo-facing assets.
Started: 2026-02-12 03:02 America/Chicago

## Codebase Patterns
- This repository currently stores product and technical deliverables as Markdown-first artifacts under `docs/` and `tests/`.
- Validation for documentation stories can be implemented as lightweight shell checks in `tests/` when no package scripts exist.
- UI implementation now uses Next.js App Router under `app/` with route-local `page.tsx` files and shared shell in `app/layout.tsx`.
- Lightweight implementation tests can run with `node:test` and file-content assertions when no browser test harness is required.
- `npm run typecheck` scans `tests/**/*.ts`; browser-spec TypeScript files require installed type dependencies (for example `@playwright/test`) to keep CI green.
- Database changes are tracked as raw SQL migrations under `db/migrations/`, with schema integrity guarded by `node:test` assertions over migration SQL contracts.
- Abuse/audit persistence should store hashed or masked identifiers (`*_hash`, redacted tokens) and avoid raw PII columns in auxiliary tables.
- Migration contract tests should assert indexed column order (not only index names) to lock intended query paths for queue and ranking endpoints.

## 2026-02-12 03:03 America/Chicago - US-001: Create Geist-aligned brand guidelines document
- Implemented `docs/brand-guidelines.md` with required sections: typography, spacing, color usage, icon rules, and accessibility guardrails.
- Added explicit privacy guardrail that attendee email never appears in public-facing UI.
- Added explicit non-endorsement wording: Geist-style conventions are referenced without claiming official Vercel endorsement.
- Added documentation test assets: `tests/brand-guidelines-tests.md` and `tests/validate-brand-guidelines.sh`.
- **Learnings:** The repo does not currently define npm scripts for build/test/typecheck, so doc validation is performed with direct shell checks.
---
## 2026-02-12 03:12 America/Chicago - US-001 retry completion
- Added `docs/ui-patterns.md` and `docs/assets.md` to satisfy cross-story acceptance dependencies flagged by verifier.
- Updated `README.md` with a short Design System section linking to brand docs.
- Kept changes isolated to `docs/` and `README.md`.
- Ran lightweight doc validation checks using `rg` due missing package scripts.
---
## 2026-02-12 03:20 America/Chicago - US-001: Scaffold Next.js alpha app shell and core routes
- Implemented initial Next.js App Router scaffold with shared shell and required routes: `/`, `/signup`, `/room`, `/admin`.
- Added persistent environment banner (`ALPHA DEMO`, `ENV: STAGE`, `PUBLIC VIEW SAFE`), shared header/subtitle, and required footer privacy statement.
- Added baseline Geist-style readable CSS layout suitable for projector/mobile demo contexts.
- Added app shell tests in `tests/app-shell.test.mjs` validating required route files and shared layout text invariants.
- **Learnings:** Introducing minimal `package.json` + TypeScript setup enables deterministic typecheck and test execution for future UI stories.
---
## 2026-02-12 03:31 America/Chicago - US-001 retry: resolve typecheck gate for brand guidelines story
- Kept `docs/brand-guidelines.md` as the source of truth with required Geist-style, privacy, and non-endorsement language.
- Fixed story verification blocker by adding `@playwright/test` as a dev dependency so repository typecheck passes with existing `tests/ui-mobile-audit.spec.ts`.
- Re-ran documentation validation for brand guideline content.
- **Learnings:** Documentation-only stories can still be blocked by repository-wide TypeScript checks when test harness dependencies are missing.
---
## 2026-02-12 04:08 America/Chicago - US-002: Add reusable UI pattern documentation for demo surfaces
- Updated `docs/ui-patterns.md` to keep required reusable pattern sections and made the privacy notice wording explicit: email is never displayed publicly on the room board.
- Updated `README.md` with an explicit `## Design System` section linking to brand, UI patterns, and assets docs.
- Added `tests/ui-patterns-docs.test.mjs` to validate required sections, required content/constraints, privacy-first language, and non-endorsement wording.
- Expanded `npm test` to run all `tests/*.test.mjs` suites so doc tests execute with existing app-shell tests.
- **Learnings:** For documentation stories in this repo, executable `node:test` content checks provide fast, deterministic acceptance coverage without adding UI harness complexity.
---
## 2026-02-12 04:24 America/Chicago - US-001 retry validation: app shell scaffold
- Verified App Router scaffold remains present for `/`, `/signup`, `/room`, `/admin` with shared `app/layout.tsx` shell.
- Re-ran acceptance checks: `npm run typecheck`, `npm test`, and `tests/validate-brand-guidelines.sh` all pass.
- No code changes were required because existing US-001 implementation already satisfies route, banner, and footer acceptance criteria.
- **Learnings:** Retry runs may be validation-only when prior commits already meet story-level requirements; keep evidence current via deterministic test output.
---
## 2026-02-12 04:33 America/Chicago - US-001 retry: strengthen app-shell acceptance coverage
- Added explicit app-shell test assertion for shared header title/subtitle rendering in `tests/app-shell.test.mjs`.
- Re-ran `npm run typecheck` and `npm test` to verify story acceptance checks remain green.
- **Learnings:** For App Router shell stories, direct source assertions in `node:test` are a fast way to enforce exact banner/header/footer copy contracts.
---
## 2026-02-15 03:18 America/Chicago - US-001: Add database schema for match generation, suggestions, and decision audit trail
- Added migration `db/migrations/202602150330_match_engine_schema.sql` creating `match_runs`, `attendee_matches`, and `match_decision_events` with deterministic score fields, status fields, timestamps, and foreign keys to preserve referential integrity.
- Added facilitator queue and top-N oriented indexes (`status`, `created_at`, `run_id`, `attendee_id`, score ordering) for approval workflow and attendee match lookup performance.
- Updated `docs/data-model.md` with documented columns for new match/audit tables and explicit privacy boundary requiring API-safe projections with no email exposure.
- Added `tests/match-engine-schema.test.mjs` covering migration existence, table creation, FK integrity, scoring/status fields, index presence, and privacy-safe schema contract checks.
- **Learnings:** SQL migration contracts can be enforced in this repo with deterministic source-level assertions, enabling schema validation without introducing a database harness.
---
## 2026-02-15 03:23 America/Chicago - US-001: Add abuse-trust schema for moderation queue and audit events
- Added migration `db/migrations/202602150340_abuse_trust_schema.sql` creating `signup_risk_events` and `signup_moderation_queue` with risk score, triggered rules, queue status, audit timestamps, and moderation resolution fields.
- Added indexes for queue triage and event correlation (`status`, `created_at`, `risk_score`, `request_fingerprint_hash`) to support filtering/sorting and lookup by hashed request fingerprint.
- Enforced privacy-at-rest constraints by modeling only `email_hash` and `email_redacted` in abuse tables with masking checks to prevent raw email storage patterns.
- Added `tests/abuse-trust-schema.test.mjs` to verify table contracts, indexes, and redaction/hash schema requirements.
- Updated `docs/data-model.md` with abuse/trust table documentation and privacy rules.
- **Learnings:** For security-focused schema stories, explicit migration-level check constraints plus source-contract tests provide strong guardrails before runtime code lands.
---
## 2026-02-15 03:30 America/Chicago - US-001: Harden match schema contract coverage
- Strengthened `tests/match-engine-schema.test.mjs` to assert deterministic-run metadata columns (`algorithm_version`, `scoring_weights`, `run_metadata`) and auditable timestamp coverage across runs/matches/decision events.
- Extended index assertions to verify key facilitator queue/top-N index column orderings on `status`, `created_at`, `run_id`, and `attendee_id` paths.
- Re-ran verification gates to confirm schema contract checks stay green.
- **Learnings:** Contract tests should validate not just index names but indexed column ordering for predictable query behavior.
