# Jobs To Be Done

This JTBD set is grounded in Dallas AI community research (`docs/research/dallas-ai-problem-research-2026-02-15.md`).

## Organizer / facilitator jobs
- When I run a Dallas AI event with mixed audience experience levels, I want live attendee signal (who is here, what they need, what they can offer) so I can adapt facilitation in real time.
- When event size spikes (100 to 300+ attendees), I want resilient check-in and board updates so room operations stay smooth.
- When attendees report outcome quality issues (for example not meeting new people), I want tools that improve relevant introductions so events feel high-impact.

## Attendee jobs
- When I scan a QR code at a live event, I want a signup flow I can finish in under 30 seconds so I can join without friction.
- When I share profile info, I want control over visibility (especially title/company) and confidence that email is never publicly exposed.
- When I attend to network, I want to find relevant people quickly based on help needed/offered so I leave with real connections.

## Ops / volunteer team jobs
- When we prepare events as a volunteer-led team, we want repeatable runbooks and deterministic validation so we can deliver consistent quality without heavy overhead.
- When abuse or spam appears during signup bursts, we want lightweight protections that do not block legitimate attendees.
- When multiple channels are in play (Meetup, LinkedIn, email), we want event-level attendee context to remain coherent in one operational view.

## Security / governance jobs
- When I review this system, I want enforceable database-boundary controls and test evidence so privacy claims are provable.
- When event stakeholders ask about trust and safety, I want clear logs, behavior constraints, and no public leak path for sensitive attendee data.

## Success tension to optimize
Dallas AI events are judged on both **quality of learning** and **quality of connection**. The product must optimize fast in-room operations and networking outcomes while preserving privacy by default.

## Skills used

- Applied `last30days` skill research workflow pattern (browser/web-source synthesis).
- Applied repository standards for JTBD documentation updates.
