# Governance / Maintainer Handoff

This repository is open source and intended for Dallas dev maintainers to take over.

## Current intent
- Ship a working, privacy-safe attendee directory demo.
- Keep data-boundary guarantees enforceable at the DB layer.

## Maintainer transition
- Short-term steward: Daniel Green + collaborators.
- Target maintainers: Dallas AI developer community.

## Decision policy (until full handoff)
- Security/privacy changes require review before merge.
- Demo reliability changes should include runtime validation updates.
- Public API/data model changes should update docs in the same PR.
